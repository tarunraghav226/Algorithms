#Euclid's Algorithm
This algorithm is used to find the gcd(greatest common divisor),also known as hcf(highest common factor), of two numbers.

One can apply different algorithms to find the gcd of two numbers.So, what is new in euclid's algorithm??

Euclid's algorithm has a very dominating factor with it,i.e, it is the efficient algorithm to find gcd of two numbers.

It reduces a number of iteration which makes it less time consuming.

#Time Complexity
Time complexity of Euclid's Algorithm is O(log(a+b)).

Here, a & b are the numbers whose gcd is to be calculated.
