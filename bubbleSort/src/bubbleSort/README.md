#Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is an algorithm to sort a given array.
This algorithm traverses The array and compares i th element with (i+1)th
element and if i th element is greater than (i+1)th element then 
we interchanges those values with each other(it is for ascending order).
The code which is given here is optimized and sorts an array in minimum number of
possible iterations.

#Time Complexity

There are two loops working in this algorithm. Their termination depends on
the number of elements in array.
So, in worst case the time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n^2)`, here n is
size of array.
